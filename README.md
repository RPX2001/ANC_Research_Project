# ANC_Research_Project
My research project on making a noise cancelling device for a drone. Here I'm making a simulation for Active Noise Cancellation using ReTM to estimate the virtual error signal based on the monitoring signal. This one for the static noise sources. Than as an extension I'm doing this part for the moving drone.
